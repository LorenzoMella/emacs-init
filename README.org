* Emacs Configuration

  A relatively minimal Emacs configuration.

** Heavy-handed additions

  - The [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][ivy/counsel/swiper]] narrowing suite, using [[https://github.com/raxod502/prescient.el][prescient]] as a backend for sorting matches;

  - Autocompletion with [[https://company-mode.github.io/][company]];

  - Support for Microsoft's Language Server Protocol, and its Emacs interface [[https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/][lsp-mode]]); as backends I configured support for [[https://github.com/MaskRay/emacs-ccls][ccls]] for C/C++ and the Jedi Language Server ([[https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/lsp-jedi/][lsp-jedi]]) for Python;

  - Emacs Speaks Statistics ([[https://ess.r-project.org/][ESS]]), the R-Studio (almost) replacement;

  
** Minor additions

   These include [[https://github.com/emacs-dashboard/emacs-dashboard][dashboard]] as a centralised front page, [[https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key][which-key]] for real-time keybinding suggestions, and the [[https://github.com/abo-abo/avy][avy]] visual text-jumping package.

** Future plans
   
  I will probably include LaTeX support in the near future.
